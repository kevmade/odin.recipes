    <p>A perfect japanese rice recipe</p>
    <p><em><h2>Ingredients</h2></em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>300g sushi rice</li>
        <li>200ml dashi</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2><em>Steps</em></h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinsing and soaking your rice is key to achieving the perfect texture. Measure the rice into a bowl, cover with cold water, then use your fingers to massage the grains of rice â€“ the water will become cloudy. Drain and rinse again with fresh water. Repeat five more times until the water stays clear.</li>
        <li>Tip the rinsed rice into a saucepan with 400ml water, or 200ml dashi and 200ml water, bring to the boil, then turn down the heat to a low simmer, cover with a tight-fitting lid with a steam hole and cook for 15 mins. Remove from the heat and leave to sit for another 15 mins, then stir through the mirin. Remove the lid and give it a good stir. Serve with any or all of the optional toppings.</li>
